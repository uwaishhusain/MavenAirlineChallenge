## About
Maven Analytics helps individuals and teams build expert-level analytics & business intelligence skills. They have started an open challenge to design one page dashboard/report by using the provided data and the winner will get the offered prize.

## Dataset
Used the provided [data][1]  in CSV format to build the report on Power BI.

## Conclusion
Firstly, I added the visulaization to show the total customers and Flight avg. arrival/departure delay. Then I added some more visulization to categorise the percentage of men and women with their classes. 
By looking at all the visualizations:
1. it is observed that the service looks bad in terms of Gate Location, Ease of online booking, and In Flight services.
2. First time customers are very less which shows the poor marketing or offers to attract the new customers.
3. Business class customers are more satisfied than other two categories.

Airline needs to review its services, policy, and pricing to improve the performance of the business.
